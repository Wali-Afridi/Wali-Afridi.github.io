            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;" align="left">
                Adapted a custom serial protocol for STM32 microcontrollers to communicate with an NVIDIA Jetson TX2 
                for the Cornell Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) team. The serial protocol utilizes a 16-byte frame structure
                with a 2-byte header, 12 bytes of data, and a 2-byte checksum for error detection. 
                The protocol uses proto-buff headers to ensure efficient data serialization and deserialization on either end.
                The protocol is designed to handle high data rates and low latency communication, essential for real-time
                control and data acquisition in underwater environments. It also includes features for error handling and 
                retransmission of lost packets, ensuring reliable communication in challenging conditions.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;" align="left">

                I am now working on making a custom CMake build system for the protocol which automatically generates 
                necessary source and header files using python scripts, and only requires users to specify the desired registers
                to be implemented as shared memory between the STM32 and Jetson. This will allow the protocol to be easily extended
                to future projects.
