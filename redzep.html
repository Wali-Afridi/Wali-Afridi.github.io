            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;" align="left"> For the 2022 FRC Season, I was responsible for the design
            of our robot's active ground intake subsystem. The intake was designed to quickly and consistently pick up 9.5" diameter oversized
            tennis balls from the ground and deliver them to our robot's shooter. It featured two sets of rollers with 2" diameter
            squish wheels and a final roller of mecanum wheels to center the ball toward our shooter.

            <p style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;" align="left"> 
                The intake was designed to be wide to make it as easy to use for our drivers as possible, and it also needed to be 
                able to be raised and lowered using pneumatic pistons to retract into our 
            robot frame. The design required the intake to fold up into just 3" of lateral space on the robot, which was an fun design
            challenge as the intake wheels themselves were 2" in diameter. I accomplished this using a two stage folding mechanism made of 
            1/4" polycarbonate plate.
