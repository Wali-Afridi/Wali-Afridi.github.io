            <p style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;" align="left"> For the 2022 FRC Season, I was responsible for the design
            of our robot's active ground intake subsystem. The intake was designed to quickly and consistently pick up 9.5" diameter oversized
            tennis balls from the ground and deliver them to our robot's shooter. The intake was designed to be wide to make it as easy to use
            for our drivers as possible, and it was also designed to be able to be raised and lowered using pneumatic pistons to retract into our 
            robot frame.
