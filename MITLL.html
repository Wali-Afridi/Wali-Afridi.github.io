            <h2>Internship Overview</h2>
            <p style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;" align="left">
                At Lincoln Laboratory, I worked on making digital electronics using superconductors with
                Adiabatic Quantum Flux Parametron (AQFP) logic. Even after taking into account cooling overhead, 
                this technology draws 100x less power than conventional CMOS devices. Current efforts are largely
                dedicated towards creating higher density memory and increasing complexity of system level designs 
                to try to compete with datacenter AI inference chips.

            <h2>Research Focus and Contributions</h2>
            <p style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;" align="left">
                I designed 2 RF PCBs to enable 5GHz testing of superconducting chips. Previously, the group had been unable to
                perform high speed testing of their chips due to inadequate test setups. My designs remedied this issue, and also
                provided a platform for showcasing multi-chip interfacing and commercial chip packaging. To do this I used Altium 
                and then simulated the designs in Ansys HFSS to ensure they would work at the desired frequencies. After fabrication, I populated
                the boards with components and tested them using a vector network analyzer. I also created documentation for testing
                procedures and results, as well as guidelines for future PCB designs and orders. 
            </p>
            <p style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;" align="left">

                Additionally, along with 2 other interns, I co-patented a novel AQFP logic 
                design topology that replaces geometric inductors with sub-critical current josephson inductance, reducing
                the area of logic and memory standard cells by 40%, and improving scalability of the technology. 
                We designed and taped out a digital logic and memory test chip of the new topology on Lincoln Lab's 350nm
                 Niobium process using Cadence Virtuoso and superconducting parasitic extraction tools.
