            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;" align="left">
                As part of the final lab in ECE 2300: Digital Logic and Computer Organization, I designed, implemented, and 
                tested two different digital systems in Verilog, and then synthesized and compared them on an FPGA. 
                The Tiny RISC-V processor was built as a minimal general-purpose CPU capable of executing a subset of 
                the RISC-V ISA, with  instruction fetch, decode, execution, and write-back stages implemented in RTL. 
                The accumulator accelerator, by contrast, was a custom hardware module optimized specifically 
                for repeated accumulation operations.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;" align="left">
                I used Verilog to implement a single-cycle processor microarchitecture that's compatible 
                with the TinyRV1 instruction set architecture (ISA), a simplified version of the popular RISC-V ISA.
                I built the processor in a modular way, designing the datapath, control unit, and memory as separate 
                pieces before putting them all together. After the design was complete, I used a rigorous testing process 
                with custom testbenches to verify that the processor would execute assembly programs exactly as expected.

            <p style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;" align="left">
                Next, I moved the design from simulation to reality by prototyping it on a physical FPGA board. 
                Using the Intel Quartus Prime software, I synthesized the Verilog code and performed static timing 
                analysis to ensure the design would run at high speeds without any issues. I was then able to configure 
                the board to run a variety of TinyRV1 assembly programs, including a simple three-function calculator.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;" align="left">
                For the final phase, I got to explore performance optimization. I designed and built a specialized 
                hardware accelerator to handle a specific accumulation task, and then I compared its performance 
                head-to-head against the general-purpose processor. I analyzed metrics like cycles per workload to 
                demonstrate the significant speedup that hardware acceleration can provide for specific tasks. 
                The entire project was managed using professional tools like Git in a Linux development environment.
