                <p style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;" align="left"> For the 2023 FRC Season, I served as Build Team Lead
                    for FRC Team 639: Code Red Robotics. On top of being responsible for ensuring the completion of our robot within
                    the 6-week timeline, I also designed two of our robot's subsystems: the end effector and the double jointed arms. 
                    The end effector was designed to pick and place cube and cone shaped game pieces, and the double jointed arms moved
                    on a tilted elevator to move the end effector to where we needed it to be. I also largely wrote the below technical 
                    binder, which helped our team to win the 2023 New York Tech Valley Regional Innovation in Control Award.
